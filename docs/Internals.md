# Internals

- `handlers`: Handle HTTP requests, interact with services, and return HTTP responses.
- `middleware`: Implement middleware functions that can be used by the Gin router.
- `models`: Define the data models for your application.
- `routes`: Define the routes and wire up the handlers.
- `services`: Contain business logic and interact with the data models. Handlers should call services to perform business operations.

## Handlers

Handlers contains the code responsible for handling HTTP requests and forming appropriate responses. 
Each file in the handlers folder may correspond to a specific set of related routes or resources.

Example:
```go
package handlers

import (
	"net/http"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"yourproject/internal/app/services"
)

// UserHandler handles HTTP requests related to users.
type UserHandler struct {
	userService services.UserService
}

// NewUserHandler creates a new instance of UserHandler.
func NewUserHandler(userService services.UserService) *UserHandler {
	return &UserHandler{
		userService: userService,
	}
}

// CreateUser handles the creation of a new user.
func (h *UserHandler) CreateUser(c *gin.Context) {
	// Parse request and call user service to create a new user.
	// Example:
	// user, err := h.userService.CreateUser(...)
	// Handle response accordingly.

	c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, gin.H{
		"message": "User created successfully",
		// Additional data if needed.
	})
}

// GetUserByID handles the retrieval of user information by ID.
func (h *UserHandler) GetUserByID(c *gin.Context) {
	// Parse request, extract user ID, and call user service to retrieve user details.
	// Example:
	// userID := c.Param("id")
	// user, err := h.userService.GetUserByID(userID)
	// Handle response accordingly.

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
		"user": "User details here",
		// Additional data if needed.
	})
}
```

### Middleware

Middleware in the context of web development, including with the Gin framework in Golang, refers to a mechanism that allows you
to intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the actual route handlers.
Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, request modification, and more. 
They sit between the client's request and the server's route handlers, allowing you to execute code before and after the route handler is called.

### Models

In the context of our app, a models typically represent the data structures or entities used by your application. 
They often correspond to database tables or other persistent storage. 

```go
// internal/app/models/user.go

package models

// User represents a user in the system.
type User struct {
	ID       uint   `json:"id"`
	Username string `json:"username"`
	Email    string `json:"email"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
	// Add other fields as needed.
}
```

### Routes


Routes in your application define the mapping between HTTP endpoints and the corresponding handlers.

```go
// internal/app/routes/routes.go

package routes

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"yourproject/internal/app/handlers"
)

// SetupRouter configures the application routes.
func SetupRouter(userHandler *handlers.UserHandler, postHandler *handlers.PostHandler) *gin.Engine {
	r := gin.Default()

	// User routes
	userRoutes := r.Group("/users")
	{
		userRoutes.POST("/", userHandler.CreateUser)
		userRoutes.GET("/:id", userHandler.GetUserByID)
		// Add other user-related routes as needed.
	}

	// Post routes
	postRoutes := r.Group("/posts")
	{
		postRoutes.POST("/", postHandler.CreatePost)
		postRoutes.GET("/:id", postHandler.GetPostByID)
		// Add other post-related routes as needed.
	}

	// Add more route groups for other resources.

	return r
}
```

### Services

Services contain the business logic of your application.
They handle the application's core functionality and interact with models and possibly external services

```go
// internal/app/services/user_service.go

package services

import "yourproject/internal/app/models"

// UserService handles user-related business logic.
type UserService struct {
	// Add any dependencies or repositories needed.
}

// NewUserService creates a new instance of UserService.
func NewUserService() *UserService {
	return &UserService{}
}

// CreateUser creates a new user.
func (s *UserService) CreateUser(user *models.User) (*models.User, error) {
	// Implement logic to create a new user, e.g., validate input, generate a password hash, etc.
	// Save the user to the database or other storage.

	// For the sake of example, let's assume the user is saved successfully.
	return user, nil
}

// GetUserByID retrieves a user by ID.
func (s *UserService) GetUserByID(userID uint) (*models.User, error) {
	// Implement logic to retrieve a user by ID from the database or other storage.

	// For the sake of example, let's assume the user is found successfully.
	return &models.User{
		ID:       userID,
		Username: "exampleUser",
		Email:    "user@example.com",
		// Set other fields as needed.
	}, nil
}
```
